                <h5 class="display-5 text-dark mt-5 mb-3 font-weight-bold" >9.2 Transfer of Personal Information to Foreign Country</h5>
                Where Personal Information is to be transferred to a country outside Nigeria, TopupBox shall put adequate measures in place to ensure the

                    settled and due to you from your transactions, minus our fees as stated in the Fee Schedule, any Reversals, Invalidated Payments, Chargebacks, 
                    Refunds or other amounts that you owe to TopupBox under this Agreement (“Payout”). If the Payout is not sufficient to cover the amounts due, 
                    you agree that we may debit your Bank Account for the applicable amounts, and/or set-off the applicable amounts against future Payouts. Upon 
                    our request, you agree to provide us with all necessary bank account and related information and grant us permission to debit amounts due 
                    from your Bank Account.
                    <br />
                    <br />

                    After transfer of funds is initiated to your Bank Account, we will update information on your TopupBox Dashboard to reflect settlement. 
                    Information regarding your transactions that are processed and settled using TopupBox (“Transaction History”) will be available to you when 
                    you login to your TopupBox Dashboard. While we will provide Transaction History in your TopupBox Dashboard, you are solely responsible for 
                    compiling and retaining permanent records of all transactions and other data associated with your TopupBox account as may be required for your 
                    business. TopupBox is not responsible for maintaining Transaction History or other records in a manner consistent with your record retention 
                    obligations.

                    <h3 class="display-5 text-dark mt-5 mb-3 font-weight-bold">Payout Schedule</h3>
                    Your Payout Schedule, which is the time it takes us to initiate a transfer to your Bank Account settled funds from card transactions processed 
                    through us is on your TopupBox Dashboard. We reserve the right to change your Payout Schedule, suspend payouts to your Bank Account or initiate 
                    a Reversal should we deem it necessary due to pending disputes, excessive or anticipated excessive Chargebacks or Refunds, or other suspicious 
                    activity associated with your use of TopupBox, or if required by law or court order.

                    <h3 class="display-5 text-dark mt-5 mb-3 font-weight-bold">How we handle your Funds</h3>
                    You authorise and instruct TopupBox to hold, receive, and disburse funds on your behalf when such funds from your card transactions settle from 
                    the Card Networks. By accepting this Agreement, you further authorise TopupBox on how your card transaction settlement funds should be disbursed 
                    to you as Payouts and the timing of such Payouts.
                    <br />
                    <br />

                    You agree that you are not entitled to any interest or other compensation associated with the settlement funds held by TopupBox pending 
                    settlement and Payout to your Bank Account.
                    <br />
                    <br />

                    Settlement funds will be held in a deposit account at TopupBox pending Payouts to you in accordance with the terms of this contract. We may 
                    periodically make available to you information about pending settlements yet to be received from the Card Networks.
                    <br />
                    <br />

                    Your authorisations will remain valid and be of full effect until your TopupBox Account is closed or terminated.

                    <h3 class="display-5 text-dark mt-5 mb-3 font-weight-bold">Security and Fraud Controls</h3>
                    TopupBox is responsible for protecting the security of Payment Data including CHD in our possession and will maintain commercially reasonable 
                    administrative, technical, and physical procedures to protect all the personal information regarding you and your customers that is stored 
                    in our servers from unauthorised access and accidental loss or modification. Although, we cannot guarantee that unauthorised third parties 
                    will never be able to defeat those measures or use such personal information for improper purposes. We will however take all reasonable and 
                    commercially achievable measures to address any security breach as soon as we become aware.
                    <br />
                    <br />

                    You agree to use other procedures and controls provided by us and other measures that are appropriate for your business to reduce the risk of 
                    fraud.
                    <br />
                    <br />

                    In the event that you suspect any fraudulent activity by a customer, you agree to notify TopupBox immediately and quit the delivery of the 
                    service. In addition, where we suspect that there have been frequent fraudulent transactions on your account, we reserve the right to cancel 
                    our service to you and/or your account

                    <h3 class="display-5 text-dark mt-5 mb-3 font-weight-bold">Notification of Errors</h3>
                    You agree to notify us immediately any error is detected while reconciling transactions that have occurred using TopupBox. We will 
                    investigate and rectify the errors where verified. In the event that we notice any errors, we will also investigate and rectify such errors.
                    <br />
                    <br />

                    Where we owe you money as a result of such errors, we will refund the amounts owed to you by a bank transfer to your Bank Account.
                    <br />
                    <br />

                    If a transaction is erroneously processed through your platform, report to us immediately. We will investigate any such reports and attempt 
                    to rectify the errors by crediting or debiting your Bank Account as appropriate.
                    <br />
                    <br />

                    Failure to notify us within 45 (forty-five) days of the occurrence of an error will be deemed a waiver of your rights to amounts that are owed 
                    to you due to an error.

                    <h3 class="display-5 text-dark mt-5 mb-3 font-weight-bold">Chargebacks</h3>
                    A Chargeback usually happens when a customer files directly with or disputes through his or her credit or debit card issuer a payment on their 
                    bill. It may result in the reversal of a transaction. You may be assessed Chargebacks for (i) customer disputes; (ii) unauthorised or improperly 
                    authorised transactions; (iii) transactions that do not comply with Card Network Rules or the terms of this Agreement or are allegedly unlawful 
                    or suspicious; or (iv) any reversals for any reason by the Card Network, our processor, or the acquiring or issuing banks. Where a Chargeback 
                    occurs, you are immediately liable for all claims, expenses, fines and liability we incur arising out of that Chargeback and agree that we may 
                    recover these amounts by debiting your Bank Account. Where these amounts are not recoverable through your Bank Account, you agree to pay all 
                    such amounts through any other means

                    <h3 class="display-5 text-dark mt-5 mb-3 font-weight-bold">Reserves</h3>
                    In our sole discretion, we may place a Reserve on a portion of your Payouts by holding for a certain period such portion where we believe there 
                    is a high level of risk associated with your business. If we take such steps, we will provide you with the terms of the Reserve which may include 
                    the percentage of your Payouts to be held back, period of time and any other such restrictions that TopupBox may deem necessary. Where such terms 
                    are changed, we will notify you. You agree that you will remain liable for all obligations related to your transactions even after the release of 
                    any Reserve. In addition, we may require you to keep your Bank Account available for any open settlements, Chargebacks and other adjustments.
                    <br />
                    <br />

                    To secure your performance of this Agreement, you grant TopupBox a legal claim to the funds held in the Reserve as a lien or security interest 
                    for amounts payable by you.

                    <h3 class="display-5 text-dark mt-5 mb-3 font-weight-bold">Refunds</h3>
                    You agree that you are solely responsible for accepting and processing returns of your products and services. We are under no obligation to process 
                    returns of your products and services, or to respond to your customers’ inquiries about returns of your products and services. You agree to submit 
                    all Refunds for returns of your products and services that were paid for through TopupBox to your customers in accordance with this Agreement and 
                    relevant Card Network Rules.

                    <h3 class="display-5 text-dark mt-5 mb-3 font-weight-bold">Termination</h3>
                    You may terminate this Agreement by closing your TopupBox Account.
